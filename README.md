### Notes
#### Issues
1. I kept getting an error: `Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while implicitly unwrapping an Optional Value`. 
  - I usually time myself whenever I do homework and problem-solving, and this particular issue took me more than an hour to fix. 
  - This was my fault since I was only completing this assignment from two days before due date.
2. Downloading CocoaPods on my terminal was another issue. 
  - Did not know the password when installing the application, because I am not Admin for the comuputer I'm using.
  - I kept on Google searching for answers, but I eventually worked around this by adding my Login as an Administrator.
##### Suggestions for Improvement
1. Will work several sessions during the week instead of long ones towards the end.
  - Utilize discussions
2. Take personal notes from the YouTube videos
